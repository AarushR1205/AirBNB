# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A clean, simple, and responsive implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.



## Description

This project is a web-based, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. Player "O" and Player "X" take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The game automatically detects a win when a player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or declares a draw if the board is full.

## Features âœ¨

* **Classic Gameplay**: Standard 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid.
* **Two-Player Mode**: Play against a friend, with "O" starting first.
* **Win/Draw Detection**: The game automatically announces the winner or if the game is a draw.
* **Reset Functionality**: A "New Game" button allows players to clear the board and start over at any time.
* **Responsive Design**: The game board and interface adapt smoothly to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
* **Clear UI**: Minimalist design with visual feedback for each player's moves.

## Technologies Used ðŸ’»

* **HTML5**: For the basic structure and content of the game.
* **CSS3**: For styling the game board, buttons, and messages. Flexbox is used for layout.
* **JavaScript (ES6)**: For all the game logic, including handling clicks, tracking turns, and checking game conditions.
